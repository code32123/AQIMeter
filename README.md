This file has information on my AQI program! All the source code can be found on [Github][1], and bug reports are welcome!

First order of business, below is recommended setup:
1.	Make a folder, wherever you want, and save the .exe file there. The exe will generate files it needs when it is run.
2.	Hold "Alt" and drag the .exe to your desktop. It should say "Create link in Desktop"\
3.	Done! The exe will generate everthing it needs wherever you put it.
Having trouble? A better guide to settings up shortcuts is here: [How To Geek][2]

Next:
Here is a list of files this program will generate. As there is not an installation process, neither is their an uninstallation process.\
If you want to remove the application, you will need to remove the .exe and the following files and folders
| File or Folder | Description |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| ```./Logs``` | A folder for storing log files |
| ```./Logs/AQILogs.txt``` | A list of all measurements. Records them newest last. |
| ```./Logs/LogX.txt``` | where "X" is a number from 1 to 99. Logs of recent activity. |
| ```./settings.json``` | A list of settings like the link to read from, the foreground color, and the background color. |

Don't call unless it's your only option! I don't answer my phone, and my voice-mail system is terrible, so it might not get to me.
Also, I will respond immediately to let you know I got your comment/question, but I might not be able to answer for a little while.

If you find a bug, reports should to [Github Issues][3]. You can message me as well, but Github is where I can organize the problems a little better, and where you can see if other people are having the same problem.
